The aim of VCFtools is to provide easily accessible methods for working with complex genetic variation data in the form of VCF files.\r\n\r\nThis toolset can be used to perform the following operations on VCF files:\r\n\r\n* Filter out specific variants\r\n* Compare files\r\n* Summarize variants\r\n* Convert to different file types\r\n* Validate and merge files\r\n* Create intersections and subsets of variants\r\n\r\nVCFtools consists of two parts, a **perl module** and a **binary executable**. The perl module is a general Perl API for manipulating VCF files, whereas the binary executable provides general analysis routines.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n* A list of usage examples can be found here.\r\n* The full Perl module documentation can be found here.\r\n* The full manual page documentation for the latest stable release of the binary executable is also available.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\nTo obtain VCFtools, please visit the downloads page.","google":"UA-272183-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
